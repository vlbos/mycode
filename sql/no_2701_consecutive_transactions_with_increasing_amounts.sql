# [2701. Consecutive Transactions with Increasing Amounts](https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-transactions-with-increasing-amounts)

 

## Description

Table: Transactions


+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the primary key of this table. 
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.  


Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing amount for at least three consecutive days. Include the customer_id, start date of the consecutive transactions period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.

Return the result table ordered by customer_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 
 ### Example 1:


Input: 
Transactions table:
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | customer_id | transaction_date | amount |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| 1        | 101     | 2023-05-01   | 100  |
| 2        | 101     | 2023-05-02   | 150  |
| 3        | 101     | 2023-05-03   | 200  |
| 4        | 102     | 2023-05-01   | 50   |
| 5        | 102     | 2023-05-03   | 100  |
| 6        | 102     | 2023-05-04   | 200  |
| 7        | 105     | 2023-05-01   | 100  |
| 8        | 105     | 2023-05-02   | 150  |
| 9        | 105     | 2023-05-03   | 200  |
| 10       | 105     | 2023-05-04   | 300  |
| 11       | 105     | 2023-05-12   | 250  |
| 12       | 105     | 2023-05-13   | 260  |
| 13       | 105     | 2023-05-14   | 270  |
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| customer_id | consecutive_start | consecutive_end | 
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| 101     |  2023-05-01   | 2023-05-03    | 
| 105     |  2023-05-01   | 2023-05-04    |
| 105     |  2023-05-12   | 2023-05-14    | 
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
Explanation: 
- customer_id 101 has made consecutive transactions with increasing amounts from May 1st, 2023, to May 3rd, 2023
- customer_id 102 does not have any consecutive transactions for at least 3 days. 
- customer_id 105 has two sets of consecutive transactions: from May 1st, 2023, to May 4th, 2023, and from May 12th, 2023, to May 14th, 2023. 
customer_id is sorted in ascending order.
