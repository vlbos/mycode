# Table: `Friends`

# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | user1       | int  |
# | user2       | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# (user1, user2) is the primary key (combination of unique values) of this table.
# Each row contains information about friendship where user1 and user2 are friends.

# Write a solution to find the popularity percentage for each user on Meta/Facebook. The popularity percentage is defined as the total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of users on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

# Return _the result table ordered by_ `user1` _in **ascending** order._

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# Friends table:
# +-------+-------+
# | user1 | user2 | 
# +-------+-------+
# | 2     | 1     | 
# | 1     | 3     | 
# | 4     | 1     | 
# | 1     | 5     | 
# | 1     | 6     |
# | 2     | 6     | 
# | 7     | 2     | 
# | 8     | 3     | 
# | 3     | 9     |  
# +-------+-------+
# **Output:** 
# +-------+-----------------------+
# | user1 | percentage\_popularity |
# +-------+-----------------------+
# | 1     | 55.56                 |
# | 2     | 33.33                 |
# | 3     | 33.33                 |
# | 4     | 11.11                 |
# | 5     | 11.11                 |
# | 6     | 22.22                 |
# | 7     | 11.11                 |
# | 8     | 11.11                 |
# | 9     | 11.11                 |
# +-------+-----------------------+
# **Explanation:** 
# There are total 9 users on the platform.
# - User "1" has friendships with 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 1 would be calculated as (5/9) \* 100 = 55.56.
# - User "2" has friendships with 1, 6 and 7. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 2 would be calculated as (3/9) \* 100 = 33.33.
# - User "3" has friendships with 1, 8 and 9. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 3 would be calculated as (3/9) \* 100 = 33.33.
# - User "4" has friendships with 1. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 4 would be calculated as (1/9) \* 100 = 11.11.
# - User "5" has friendships with 1. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 5 would be calculated as (1/9) \* 100 = 11.11.
# - User "6" has friendships with 1 and 2. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 6 would be calculated as (2/9) \* 100 = 22.22.
# - User "7" has friendships with 2. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 7 would be calculated as (1/9) \* 100 = 11.11.
# - User "8" has friendships with 3. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 8 would be calculated as (1/9) \* 100 = 11.11.
# - User "9" has friendships with 3. Therefore, the percentage popularity for user 9 would be calculated as (1/9) \* 100 = 11.11.
# user1 is sorted in ascending order.
