# Table: `Wineries`

# +-------------+----------+
# | Column Name | Type     |
# +-------------+----------+
# | id          | int      |
# | country     | varchar  |
# | points      | int      |
# | winery      | varchar  |

# id is column of unique values for this table.
# This table contains id, country, points, and winery.

# Write a solution to find the **top three wineries** in **each** **country** based on their **total points**. If **multiple wineries** have the **same** total points, order them by `winery` name in **ascending** order. If there's **no second winery**, output 'No Second Winery,' and if there's **no third winery**, output 'No Third Winery.'

# Return _the result table ordered by_ `country` _in **ascending** order__._

# The result format is in the following example.
