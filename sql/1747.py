# Table: `LogInfo`

# +-------------+----------+
# | Column Name | Type     |
# +-------------+----------+
# | account\_id  | int      |
# | ip\_address  | int      |
# | login       | datetime |
# | logout      | datetime |
# +-------------+----------+
# This table may contain duplicate rows.
# The table contains information about the login and logout dates of Leetflex accounts. It also contains the IP address from which the account was logged in and out.
# It is guaranteed that the logout time is after the login time.

# Write a solution to find the `account_id` of the accounts that should be banned from Leetflex. An account should be banned if it was logged in at some moment from two different IP addresses.

# Return the result table in **any order**.

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# LogInfo table:
# +------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+
# | account\_id | ip\_address | login               | logout              |
# +------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+
# | 1          | 1          | 2021-02-01 09:00:00 | 2021-02-01 09:30:00 |
# | 1          | 2          | 2021-02-01 08:00:00 | 2021-02-01 11:30:00 |
# | 2          | 6          | 2021-02-01 20:30:00 | 2021-02-01 22:00:00 |
# | 2          | 7          | 2021-02-02 20:30:00 | 2021-02-02 22:00:00 |
# | 3          | 9          | 2021-02-01 16:00:00 | 2021-02-01 16:59:59 |
# | 3          | 13         | 2021-02-01 17:00:00 | 2021-02-01 17:59:59 |
# | 4          | 10         | 2021-02-01 16:00:00 | 2021-02-01 17:00:00 |
# | 4          | 11         | 2021-02-01 17:00:00 | 2021-02-01 17:59:59 |
# +------------+------------+---------------------+---------------------+
# **Output:** 
# +------------+
# | account\_id |
# +------------+
# | 1          |
# | 4          |
# +------------+
# **Explanation:** 
# Account ID 1 --> The account was active from "2021-02-01 09:00:00" to "2021-02-01 09:30:00" with two different IP addresses (1 and 2). It should be banned.
# Account ID 2 --> The account was active from two different addresses (6, 7) but in **two different times**.
# Account ID 3 --> The account was active from two different addresses (9, 13) on the same day but **they do not intersect at any moment**.
# Account ID 4 --> The account was active from "2021-02-01 17:00:00" to "2021-02-01 17:00:00" with two different IP addresses (10 and 11). It should be banned.
