-- # [2494. Merge Overlapping Events in the Same Hall](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-overlapping-events-in-the-same-hall)


-- ## Description

-- Table: HallEvents


-- +-------------+------+
-- | Column Name | Type |
-- +-------------+------+
-- | hall_id     | int  |
-- | start_day   | date |
-- | end_day     | date |
-- +-------------+------+
-- There is no primary key in this table. It may contain duplicates.
-- Each row of this table indicates the start day and end day of an event and the hall in which the event is held.


 

-- Write an SQL query to merge all the overlapping events that are held in the same hall. Two events overlap if they have at least one day in common.

-- Return the result table in any order.

-- The query result format is in the following example.

 
--  ### Example 1:


-- Input: 
-- HallEvents table:
-- +---------+------------+------------+
-- | hall_id | start_day  | end_day    |
-- +---------+------------+------------+
-- | 1       | 2023-01-13 | 2023-01-14 |
-- | 1       | 2023-01-14 | 2023-01-17 |
-- | 1       | 2023-01-18 | 2023-01-25 |
-- | 2       | 2022-12-09 | 2022-12-23 |
-- | 2       | 2022-12-13 | 2022-12-17 |
-- | 3       | 2022-12-01 | 2023-01-30 |
-- +---------+------------+------------+
-- Output: 
-- +---------+------------+------------+
-- | hall_id | start_day  | end_day    |
-- +---------+------------+------------+
-- | 1       | 2023-01-13 | 2023-01-17 |
-- | 1       | 2023-01-18 | 2023-01-25 |
-- | 2       | 2022-12-09 | 2022-12-23 |
-- | 3       | 2022-12-01 | 2023-01-30 |
-- +---------+------------+------------+
-- Explanation: There are three halls.
-- Hall 1:
-- - The two events [&quot;2023-01-13&quot;, &quot;2023-01-14&quot;] and [&quot;2023-01-14&quot;, &quot;2023-01-17&quot;] overlap. We merge them in one event [&quot;2023-01-13&quot;, &quot;2023-01-17&quot;].
-- - The event [&quot;2023-01-18&quot;, &quot;2023-01-25&quot;] does not overlap with any other event, so we leave it as it is.
-- Hall 2:
-- - The two events [&quot;2022-12-09&quot;, &quot;2022-12-23&quot;] and [&quot;2022-12-13&quot;, &quot;2022-12-17&quot;] overlap. We merge them in one event [&quot;2022-12-09&quot;, &quot;2022-12-23&quot;].
-- Hall 3:
-- - The hall has only one event, so we return it. Note that we only consider the events of each hall separately.

### **SQL**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH
    S AS (
        SELECT
            hall_id,
            start_day,
            end_day,
            max(end_day) OVER (
                PARTITION BY hall_id
                ORDER BY start_day
            ) AS cur_max_end_day
        FROM HallEvents
    ),
    T AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            if(
                start_day <= lag(cur_max_end_day) OVER (
                    PARTITION BY hall_id
                    ORDER BY start_day
                ),
                0,
                1
            ) AS start
        FROM S
    ),
    P AS (
        SELECT
            *,
            sum(start) OVER (
                PARTITION BY hall_id
                ORDER BY start_day
            ) AS gid
        FROM T
    )
SELECT hall_id, min(start_day) AS start_day, max(end_day) AS end_day
FROM P
GROUP BY hall_id, gid;
