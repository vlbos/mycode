# Table: Follow

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | followee    | varchar |
# | follower    | varchar |
# +-------------+---------+
# (followee, follower) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table indicates that the user follower follows the user followee on a social network.
# There will not be a user following themself.
 

# A second-degree follower is a user who:

# follows at least one user, and
# is followed by at least one user.
# Write a solution to report the second-degree users and the number of their followers.

# Return the result table ordered by follower in alphabetical order.

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# Follow table:
# +----------+----------+
# | followee | follower |
# +----------+----------+
# | Alice    | Bob      |
# | Bob      | Cena     |
# | Bob      | Donald   |
# | Donald   | Edward   |
# +----------+----------+
# Output: 
# +----------+-----+
# | follower | num |
# +----------+-----+
# | Bob      | 2   |
# | Donald   | 1   |
# +----------+-----+
# Explanation: 
# User Bob has 2 followers. Bob is a second-degree follower because he follows Alice, so we include him in the result table.
# User Donald has 1 follower. Donald is a second-degree follower because he follows Bob, so we include him in the result table.
# User Alice has 1 follower. Alice is not a second-degree follower because she does not follow anyone, so we don not include her in the result table.
