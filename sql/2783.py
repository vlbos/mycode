# Table: `Flights`

# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | flight\_id   | int  |
# | capacity    | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# `flight_id` is the column with unique values for this table.
# Each row of this table contains flight id and its capacity.

# Table: `Passengers`

# +--------------+------+
# | Column Name  | Type |
# +--------------+------+
# | passenger\_id | int  |
# | flight\_id    | int  |
# +--------------+------+
# passenger\_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# Each row of this table contains passenger id and flight id.

# Passengers book tickets for flights in advance. If a passenger books a ticket for a flight and there are still empty seats available on the flight, the passenger ticket will be **confirmed**. However, the passenger will be on a **waitlist** if the flight is already at full capacity.

# Write a solution to report the number of passengers who successfully booked a flight (got a seat) and the number of passengers who are on the waitlist for each flight.

# Return the result table ordered by `flight_id` in **ascending** _**order**._

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# Flights table:
# +-----------+----------+
# | flight\_id | capacity |
# +-----------+----------+
# | 1         | 2        |
# | 2         | 2        |
# | 3         | 1        |
# +-----------+----------+
# Passengers table:
# +--------------+-----------+
# | passenger\_id | flight\_id |
# +--------------+-----------+
# | 101          | 1         |
# | 102          | 1         |
# | 103          | 1         |
# | 104          | 2         |
# | 105          | 2         |
# | 106          | 3         |
# | 107          | 3         |
# +--------------+-----------+
# **Output:** 
# +-----------+------------+--------------+
# | flight\_id | booked\_cnt | waitlist\_cnt |
# +-----------+------------+--------------+
# | 1         | 2          | 1            |
# | 2         | 2          | 0            |
# | 3         | 1          | 1            |
# +-----------+------------+--------------+
# **Explanation:** 
# - Flight 1 has a capacity of 2. As there are 3 passengers who have booked tickets, only 2 passengers can get a seat. Therefore, 2 passengers are successfully booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.
# - Flight 2 has a capacity of 2. Since there are exactly 2 passengers who booked tickets, everyone can secure a seat. As a result, 2 passengers successfully booked their seats and there are no passengers on the waitlist.
# - Flight 3 has a capacity of 1. As there are 2 passengers who have booked tickets, only 1 passenger can get a seat. Therefore, 1 passenger is successfully booked, and 1 passenger is on the waitlist.
