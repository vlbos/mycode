# Table: `CoffeeShop`

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | id          | int     |
# | drink       | varchar |
# +-------------+---------+
# id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row in this table shows the order id and the name of the drink ordered. Some drink rows are nulls.

# Write a solution to replace the `null` values of the drink with the name of the drink of the previous row that is not `null`. It is guaranteed that the drink on the first row of the table is not `null`.

# Return the result table **in the same order as the input**.

# The result format is shown in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# CoffeeShop table:
# +----+-------------------+
# | id | drink             |
# +----+-------------------+
# | 9  | Rum and Coke      |
# | 6  | null              |
# | 7  | null              |
# | 3  | St Germain Spritz |
# | 1  | Orange Margarita  |
# | 2  | null              |
# +----+-------------------+
# **Output:** 
# +----+-------------------+
# | id | drink             |
# +----+-------------------+
# | 9  | Rum and Coke      |
# | 6  | Rum and Coke      |
# | 7  | Rum and Coke      |
# | 3  | St Germain Spritz |
# | 1  | Orange Margarita  |
# | 2  | Orange Margarita  |
# +----+-------------------+
# **Explanation:** 
# For ID 6, the previous value that is not null is from ID 9. We replace the null with "Rum and Coke".
# For ID 7, the previous value that is not null is from ID 9. We replace the null with "Rum and Coke;.
# For ID 2, the previous value that is not null is from ID 1. We replace the null with "Orange Margarita".
# Note that the rows in the output are the same as in the input.
