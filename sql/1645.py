# +--------------+---------+
# ride\_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# Each row of this table contains the ID of a ride, the user's ID that requested it, and the day they requested it.
# There may be some ride requests in this table that were not accepted.

# Table: `AcceptedRides`

# +---------------+---------+
# | Column Name   | Type    |
# +---------------+---------+
# | ride\_id       | int     |

# +---------------+---------+
# ride\_id is the column with unique values for this table.
# Each row of this table contains some information about an accepted ride.
# It is guaranteed that each accepted ride exists in the Rides table.

# Write a solution to report the **percentage** of working drivers (`working_percentage`) for each month of **2020** where:

# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/31/codecogseqn.png)

# **Note** that if the number of available drivers during a month is zero, we consider the `working_percentage` to be `0`.

# Return the result table ordered by `month` in **ascending** order, where `month` is the month's number (January is `1`, February is `2`, etc.). Round `working_percentage` to the nearest **2 decimal places**.

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Explanation:** 
# By the end of January --> two active drivers (10, 8) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
# By the end of February --> three active drivers (10, 8, 5) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
# By the end of March --> four active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7) and one accepted ride by driver (10). The percentage is (1 / 4) \* 100 = 25%.
# By the end of April --> four active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
# By the end of May --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
# By the end of June --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and one accepted ride by driver (10). The percentage is (1 / 5) \* 100 = 20%.
# By the end of July --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and one accepted ride by driver (8). The percentage is (1 / 5) \* 100 = 20%.
# By the end of August --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and one accepted ride by driver (7). The percentage is (1 / 5) \* 100 = 20%.
# By the end of September --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
# By the end of October --> six active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
# By the end of November --> six active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1) and two accepted rides by **two different** drivers (1, 7). The percentage is (2 / 6) \* 100 = 33.33%.
# By the end of December --> six active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1) and one accepted ride by driver (4). The percentage is (1 / 6) \* 100 = 16.67%.
