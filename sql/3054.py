# Table: `Tree`

# +-------------+------+ 
# | Column Name | Type | 
# +-------------+------+ 
# | N           | int  | 
# | P           | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# N is the column of unique values for this table.
# Each row includes N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

# Write a solution to find the node type of the Binary Tree. Output one of the following for each node:

# *   **Root**: if the node is the root node.
# *   **Leaf**: if the node is the leaf node.
# *   **Inner**: if the node is neither root nor leaf node.

# Return _the result table ordered by node value in **ascending order**_.

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# Tree table:
# +---+------+
# | N | P    | 
# +---+------+
# | 1 | 2    |
# | 3 | 2    | 
# | 6 | 8    | 
# | 9 | 8    | 
# | 2 | 5    | 
# | 8 | 5    | 
# | 5 | null | 
# +---+------+
# **Output:** 
# +---+-------+
# | N | Type  | 
# +---+-------+
# | 1 | Leaf  | 
# | 2 | Inner |
# | 3 | Leaf  |
# | 5 | Root  |
# | 6 | Leaf  |
# | 8 | Inner |
# | 9 | Leaf  |    
# +---+-------+
# **Explanation:** 
# - Node 5 is the root node since it has no parent node.
# - Nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9 are leaf nodes because they don't have any child nodes.
# - Nodes 2, and 8 are inner nodes as they serve as parents to some of the nodes in the structure.

# **Note:** This question is the same as [608: Tree Node.](https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/description/)
