# Table: `Drivers`

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | driver\_id   | int     |
# | join\_date   | date    |
# +-------------+---------+
# driver\_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table contains the driver's ID and the date they joined the Hopper company.

# Table: `Rides`

# +--------------+---------+
# | Column Name  | Type    |
# +--------------+---------+
# | ride\_id      | int     |
# | user\_id      | int     |
# | requested\_at | date    |
# +--------------+---------+
# ride\_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table contains the ID of a ride, the user's ID that requested it, and the day they requested it.
# There may be some ride requests in this table that were not accepted.

# Table: `AcceptedRides`

# +---------------+---------+
# | Column Name   | Type    |
# +---------------+---------+
# | ride\_id       | int     |
# | driver\_id     | int     |
# | ride\_distance | int     |
# | ride\_duration | int     |
# +---------------+---------+
# ride\_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table contains some information about an accepted ride.
# It is guaranteed that each accepted ride exists in the Rides table.

# Write a solution to report the following statistics for each month of **2020**:

# *   The number of drivers currently with the Hopper company by the end of the month (`active_drivers`).
# *   The number of accepted rides in that month (`accepted_rides`).

# Return the result table ordered by `month` in ascending order, where `month` is the month's number (January is `1`, February is `2`, etc.).

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# Drivers table:
# +-----------+------------+
# | driver\_id | join\_date  |
