# Table: `Products`

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | product\_id  | int     |
# | store       | varchar |
# | price       | int     |
# +-------------+---------+
# (product\_id, store) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table indicates the price of product\_id in store.
# There will be at most 30 different stores in the table.
# price is the price of the product at this store.

# **Important note:** This problem targets those who have a good experience with SQL. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you skip it for now.

# Implement the procedure `PivotProducts` to reorganize the `Products` table so that each row has the id of one product and its price in each store. The price should be `null` if the product is not sold in a store. The columns of the table should contain each store and they should be sorted in **lexicographical order**.

# The procedure should return the table after reorganizing it.

# Return the result table in **any order**.

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# Products table:
# +------------+----------+-------+
# | product\_id | store    | price |
# +------------+----------+-------+
# | 1          | Shop     | 110   |
# | 1          | LC\_Store | 100   |
# | 2          | Nozama   | 200   |
# | 2          | Souq     | 190   |
# | 3          | Shop     | 1000  |
# | 3          | Souq     | 1900  |
# +------------+----------+-------+
# **Output:** 
# +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
# | product\_id | LC\_Store | Nozama | Shop | Souq |
# +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
# | 1          | 100      | null   | 110  | null |
# | 2          | null     | 200    | null | 190  |
# | 3          | null     | null   | 1000 | 1900 |
# +------------+----------+--------+------+------+
# **Explanation:** 
# We have 4 stores: Shop, LC\_Store, Nozama, and Souq. We first order them lexicographically to be: LC\_Store, Nozama, Shop, and Souq.
# Now, for product 1, the price in LC\_Store is 100 and in Shop is 110. For the other two stores, the product is not sold so we set the price as null.
# Similarly, product 2 has a price of 200 in Nozama and 190 in Souq. It is not sold in the other two stores.
# For product 3, the price is 1000 in Shop and 1900 in Souq. It is not sold in the other two stores.
