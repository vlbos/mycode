# Table: `Spotify`

# +-------------+---------+ 
# | Column Name | Type    | 
# +-------------+---------+ 
# | id          | int     | 
# | track\_name  | varchar |
# | artist      | varchar |
# +-------------+---------+
# `id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row contains an id, track\_name, and artist.

# Write a solution to find how many times each artist appeared on the Spotify ranking list.

# Return the result table having the artist's name along with the corresponding number of occurrences ordered by occurrence count in **descending** order. If the occurrences are equal, then it’s ordered by the artist’s name in **ascending** order.

# The result format is in the following example​​​​​.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** Spotify table: 
# +---------+--------------------+------------+ 
# | id      | track\_name         | artist     |  
# +---------+--------------------+------------+
# | 303651  | Heart Won't Forget | Sia        |
# | 1046089 | Shape of you       | Ed Sheeran |
# | 33445   | I'm the one        | DJ Khalid  |
# | 811266  | Young Dumb & Broke | DJ Khalid  | 
# | 505727  | Happier            | Ed Sheeran |
# +---------+--------------------+------------+ 
# **Output:** +------------+-------------+
# | artist     | occurrences | 
# +------------+-------------+
# | DJ Khalid  | 2           |
# | Ed Sheeran | 2           |
# | Sia        | 1           | 
# +------------+-------------+ 

# **Explanation:** The count of occurrences is listed in descending order under the column name "occurrences". If the number of occurrences is the same, the artist's names are sorted in ascending order.
