# Table: `Events`

# +---------------+---------+
# | Column Name   | Type    |
# +---------------+---------+
# | business\_id   | int     |
# | event\_type    | varchar |
# | occurrences   | int     | 
# +---------------+---------+
# (business\_id, event\_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
# Each row in the table logs the info that an event of some type occurred at some business for a number of times.

# The **average activity** for a particular `event_type` is the average `occurrences` across all companies that have this event.

# An **active business** is a business that has **more than one** `event_type` such that their `occurrences` is **strictly greater** than the average activity for that event.

# Write a solution to find all **active businesses**.

# Return the result table in **any order**.

# The result format is in the following example.

# **Example 1:**

# **Input:** 
# Events table:
# +-------------+------------+-------------+
# | business\_id | event\_type | occurrences |
# +-------------+------------+-------------+
# | 1           | reviews    | 7           |
# | 3           | reviews    | 3           |
# | 1           | ads        | 11          |
# | 2           | ads        | 7           |
# | 3           | ads        | 6           |
# | 1           | page views | 3           |
# | 2           | page views | 12          |
# +-------------+------------+-------------+
# **Output:** 
# +-------------+
# | business\_id |
# +-------------+
# | 1           |
# +-------------+
# **Explanation:**  
# The average activity for each event can be calculated as follows:
# - 'reviews': (7+3)/2 = 5
# - 'ads': (11+7+6)/3 = 8
# - 'page views': (3+12)/2 = 7.5
# The business with id=1 has 7 'reviews' events (more than 5) and 11 'ads' events (more than 8), so it is an active business.
