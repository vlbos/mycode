// # [2664. The Knightâ€™s Tour](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-knights-tour)

// ## Description

//  Given two positive integers  m  and  n  which are the height and width of a  0-indexed  2D-array  board ,
// a pair of positive integers  (r, c)  which is the starting position of the knight on the board.

//  Your task is to find an order of movements for the knight,
// in a manner that every cell of the  board  gets visited  exactly  once (the starting cell is considered visited and you  shouldn't  visit it again).

//  Return  the array   board   in which the cells'values show the order of visiting the cell starting from 0 (the initial place of the knight).

//  Note that a  knight  can  move  from cell  (r1, c1)  to cell  (r2, c2)
// if  0  <= r2  <= m - 1  and  0  <= c2  <= n - 1  and  min(abs(r1 - r2),
// abs(c1 - c2)) = 1  and  max(abs(r1 - r2), abs(c1 - c2)) = 2 .

//   Example 1:

//  Input:  m = 1, n = 1, r = 0, c = 0
//  Output:  [[0]]
//  Explanation:  There is only 1 cell and the knight is initially on it so there is only a 0 inside the 1x1 grid.

//   Example 2:

//  Input:  m = 3, n = 4, r = 0, c = 0
//  Output:  [[0,3,6,9],[11,8,1,4],[2,5,10,7]]
//  Explanation:  By the following order of movements we can visit the entire board.
// (0,0)->(1,2)->(2,0)->(0,1)->(1,3)->(2,1)->(0,2)->(2,3)->(1,1)->(0,3)->(2,2)->(1,0)

//   Constraints:

// 	  1  <= m, n  <= 5
// 	  0  <= r  <= m - 1
// 	  0  <= c  <= n - 1
// 	 The inputs will be generated such that there exists at least one possible order of movements with the given condition
