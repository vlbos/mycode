// # [2445. Number of Nodes With Value One 🔒](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-nodes-with-value-one)

// ## Description

//   There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n and n - 1 edges. You are given the integer n  . The parent node of a node with a label v is the node with the label floor (v / 2)  . The root of the tree is the node with the label 1  .

// 	  For example, if n = 7  , then the node with the label 3 has the node with the label floor(3 / 2) = 1 as its parent, and the node with the label 7 has the node with the label floor(7 / 2) = 3 as its parent.

//   You are also given an integer array queries  . Initially, every node has a value 0 on it. For each query queries[i]  , you should flip all values in the subtree of the node with the label queries[i]  .

//   Return the total number of nodes with the value   1   after processing all the queries  .

//   Note that:

// 	  Flipping the value of a node means that the node with the value 0 becomes 1 and vice versa.
// 	  floor(x) is equivalent to rounding x down to the nearest integer.

//   Example 1:

//   Input: n = 5 , queries = [1,2,5]
//   Output: 3
//   Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree structure and its status after performing the queries. The blue node represents the value 0, and the red node represents the value 1.
// After processing the queries, there are three red nodes (nodes with value 1): 1, 3, and 5.

//   Example 2:

//   Input: n = 3, queries = [2,3,3]
//   Output: 1
//   Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree structure and its status after performing the queries. The blue node represents the value 0, and the red node represents the value 1.
// After processing the queries, there are one red node (node with value 1): 2.

//   Constraints:

// 	  1 <= n <= 10  5
// 	  1 <= queries.length <= 10  5
// 	  1 <= queries[i] <= n
