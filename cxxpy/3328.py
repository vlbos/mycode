# Table: cities

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    | 
# +-------------+---------+
# | state       | varchar |
# | city        | varchar |
# +-------------+---------+
# (state, city) is the combination of columns with unique values for this table.
# Each row of this table contains the state name and the city name within that state.
# Write a solution to find all the cities in each state and analyze them based on the following requirements:

# Combine all cities into a comma-separated string for each state.
# Only include states that have at least 3 cities.
# Only include states where at least one city starts with the same letter as the state name.
# Return the result table ordered by the count of matching-letter cities in descending order and then by state name in ascending order.

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example:

# Input:

# cities table:

# +--------------+---------------+
# | state        | city          |
# +--------------+---------------+
# | New York     | New York City |
# | New York     | Newark        |
# | New York     | Buffalo       |
# | New York     | Rochester     |
# | California   | San Francisco |
# | California   | Sacramento    |
# | California   | San Diego     |
# | California   | Los Angeles   |
# | Texas        | Tyler         |
# | Texas        | Temple        |
# | Texas        | Taylor        |
# | Texas        | Dallas        |
# | Pennsylvania | Philadelphia  |
# | Pennsylvania | Pittsburgh    |
# | Pennsylvania | Pottstown     |
# +--------------+---------------+
# Output:

# +-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
# | state       | cities                                    | matching_letter_count |
# +-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
# | Pennsylvania| Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pottstown       | 3                     |
# | Texas       | Dallas, Taylor, Temple, Tyler             | 3                     |
# | New York    | Buffalo, Newark, New York City, Rochester | 2                     |
# +-------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------+
# Explanation:

# Pennsylvania:
# Has 3 cities (meets minimum requirement)
# All 3 cities start with 'P' (same as state)
# matching_letter_count = 3
# Texas:
# Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
# 3 cities (Taylor, Temple, Tyler) start with 'T' (same as state)
# matching_letter_count = 3
# New York:
# Has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
# 2 cities (Newark, New York City) start with 'N' (same as state)
# matching_letter_count = 2
# California is not included in the output because:
# Although it has 4 cities (meets minimum requirement)
# No cities start with 'C' (doesn't meet the matching letter requirement)
# Note:

# Results are ordered by matching_letter_count in descending order
# When matching_letter_count is the same (Texas and New York both have 2), they are ordered by state name alphabetically
# Cities in each row are ordered alphabetically
