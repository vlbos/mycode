# 3401. Find Circular Gift Exchange Chains

# Table: SecretSanta

# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | giver_id    | int  |
# | receiver_id | int  |
# | gift_value  | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# (giver_id, receiver_id) is the unique key for this table.   
# Each row represents a record of a gift exchange between two employees, giver_id represents the employee who gives a gift, receiver_id represents the employee who receives the gift and gift_value represents the value of the gift given.  
# Write a solution to find the total gift value and length of circular chains of Secret Santa gift exchanges:

# A circular chain is defined as a series of exchanges where:

# Each employee gives a gift to exactly one other employee.
# Each employee receives a gift from exactly one other employee.
# The exchanges form a continuous loop (e.g., employee A gives a gift to B, B gives to C, and C gives back to A).
# Return the result ordered by the chain length and total gift value of the chain in descending order. 

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example:

# Input:

# SecretSanta table:

# +----------+-------------+------------+
# | giver_id | receiver_id | gift_value |
# +----------+-------------+------------+
# | 1        | 2           | 20         |
# | 2        | 3           | 30         |
# | 3        | 1           | 40         |
# | 4        | 5           | 25         |
# | 5        | 4           | 35         |
# +----------+-------------+------------+
# Output:

# +----------+--------------+------------------+
# | chain_id | chain_length | total_gift_value |
# +----------+--------------+------------------+
# | 1        | 3            | 90               |
# | 2        | 2            | 60               |
# +----------+--------------+------------------+
# Explanation:

# Chain 1 involves employees 1, 2, and 3:
# Employee 1 gives a gift to 2, employee 2 gives a gift to 3, and employee 3 gives a gift to 1.
# Total gift value for this chain = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.
# Chain 2 involves employees 4 and 5:
# Employee 4 gives a gift to 5, and employee 5 gives a gift to 4.
# Total gift value for this chain = 25 + 35 = 60.
# The result table is ordered by the chain length and total gift value of the chain in descending order.
