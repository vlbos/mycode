# Table: Teams

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | player_id   | int     |
# | team_name   | varchar | 
# +-------------+---------+
# player_id is the unique key for this table.
# Each row contains the unique identifier for player and the name of one of the teams participating in that match.
# Table: Passes

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | pass_from   | int     |
# | time_stamp  | varchar |
# | pass_to     | int     |
# +-------------+---------+
# (pass_from, time_stamp) is the unique key for this table.
# pass_from is a foreign key to player_id from Teams table.
# Each row represents a pass made during a match, time_stamp represents the time in minutes (00:00-90:00) when the pass was made,
# pass_to is the player_id of the player receiving the pass.
# Write a solution to find the longest successful pass streak for each team during the match. The rules are as follows:

# A successful pass streak is defined as consecutive passes where:
# Both the pass_from and pass_to players belong to the same team
# A streak breaks when either:
# The pass is intercepted (received by a player from the opposing team)
# Return the result table ordered by team_name in ascending order.

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example:

# Input:

# Teams table:

# +-----------+-----------+
# | player_id | team_name |
# +-----------+-----------+
# | 1         | Arsenal   |
# | 2         | Arsenal   |
# | 3         | Arsenal   |
# | 4         | Arsenal   |
# | 5         | Chelsea   |
# | 6         | Chelsea   |
# | 7         | Chelsea   |
# | 8         | Chelsea   |
# +-----------+-----------+
# Passes table:

# +-----------+------------+---------+
# | pass_from | time_stamp | pass_to |
# +-----------+------------+---------+
# | 1         | 00:05      | 2       |
# | 2         | 00:07      | 3       |
# | 3         | 00:08      | 4       |
# | 4         | 00:10      | 5       |
# | 6         | 00:15      | 7       |
# | 7         | 00:17      | 8       |
# | 8         | 00:20      | 6       |
# | 6         | 00:22      | 5       |
# | 1         | 00:25      | 2       |
# | 2         | 00:27      | 3       |
# +-----------+------------+---------+
# Output:

# +-----------+----------------+
# | team_name | longest_streak |
# +-----------+----------------+
# | Arsenal   | 3              |
# | Chelsea   | 4              |
# +-----------+----------------+
# Explanation:

# Arsenal's streaks:
# First streak: 3 passes (1→2→3→4) ended when player 4 passed to Chelsea's player 5
# Second streak: 2 passes (1→2→3)
# Longest streak = 3
# Chelsea's streaks:
# First streak: 3 passes (6→7→8→6→5)
# Longest streak = 4
